# NeuralNet

The blog post describing this repository can be found here: https://tim-beatham.github.io/Week2/Week2.html and https://tim-beatham.github.io/Week2/NeuralNet.html

During this project I created my own neural network from scratch in the Python programming language. I used library numpy to implement the linear algebra equations.

By the end of the project I trained my neural network to recognise digits in a picture.
